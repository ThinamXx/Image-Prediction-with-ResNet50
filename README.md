# Image-Prediction-with-ResNet50
In this repository, I am going to predict the image using the pre-trained ResNet50 modules. ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. ResNet50 is a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.
