# **Image Prediction**

**ResNet50**
- ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.

**Note:**
- In this Project, I have used ResNet50 to predict the Image. It's a simple project on Image Prediction.
